India launched its first space mission of 2022 late Sunday (Feb. 13) to send a new Earth observation satellite to space alongside two smaller rideshare satellites. 

A Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle built by the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the Earth Observation Satellite 4 (EOS-4) into orbit at 7:29 p.m. EST (0029 GMT or 6:29 p.m. local time Monday, Feb. 14) from a pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, off the Bay of Bengal.

ISRO's s previous launch in this series, EOS-03, suffered a catastrophic failure during liftoff in August 2021. ISRO later said the cause was "a failure to ignite the cryogenic stage of the launch vehicle," according to India's Economic Times. Sunday's launch of the PSLV rocket went off without a hitch.
